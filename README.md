## Introductioin
This is a research project supported by [HERE](https://www.here.com/en) company.
Therefore, the datasets and some codes of the algorithm are confidential so won't be shown in this repo.If you want to learn more about the dataset and algorithm, please read this project's paper [Lane Boundary Extraction from Satellite Imagery](other_file.md)

Automated driving is becoming a reality. In this new reality, High
Definition (HD) Maps play an important role in path planning and
vehicle localization. Lane boundary geometry is one of the key components
of an HD Map. Such maps are typically created from ground
level LiDAR and imagery data, while useful in many ways, have
many limitations such as prohibitive cost, infrequent update, traffic
occlusions, and incomplete coverage. In this project, we propose
a novel method to automatically extract lane boundary from satellite
imagery using pixel-wise segmentation and machine learning,
and convert unstructured lines into structured road model by using
hypothesis linking algorithm, which addresses the aforementioned
limitations. We also publish our experiment dataset consisting of
satellite imagery and the corresponding lane boundaries as ground
truth to train, test, and evaluate algorithms.
